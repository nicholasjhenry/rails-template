Note: This is the first cut converting the Rail 2.x template to Rails 3.x. There are some template API changes that makes this implementation look a "little ugly". These will be fixed.

h1. Template Description

* Assumes a Heroku deployment platform
* Uses RSpec and Cucumber for Testing

h1. Setup/Installation

$ rails myproject -m /path/to/firsthand.rb

h1. Next Steps

Then give it a whirl:

$ cd myproject
$ rake db:create
$ script/generate scaffold post title:string body:text
$ rake db:migrate
$ script/server
