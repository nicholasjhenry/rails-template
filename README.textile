h1. Template Description

* RSpec for unit testing and Cucumber for acceptance testing.
* Compass and Haml for templating.

h1. Setup/Installation

$ rails new myproject -m /path/to/firsthand.rb --skip-test-unit

h1. Next Steps

Then give it a whirl:

$ cd myproject
$ rake db:create
$ rails g scaffold post title:string body:text
$ rake db:migrate
$ script/server

Visit:

http://localhost:3000/posts

You can also run the generated spec using <tt>rake spec</tt>.

h1. Running a Single Recipe

You can also run a single reciple in an existing application by passing in the RECIPE name:

rake rails:template LOCATION=/path/to/firsthand.rb RECIPE=compass

In this case, this will only run the compass recipe. You will be required to commit changes to source control yourself after the recipe has been run. What recipes can be run? See <tt>./recipes</tt>.
